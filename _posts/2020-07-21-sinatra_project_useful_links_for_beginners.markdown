**Working on my Sinatra project was the first time that I got to flex my Google skills in the context of development.** 
<br>


In my first couple weeks of learning to code I took pages of notes, conflating memorizing syntax with learning how to be a software engineer. I quickly realised that I what I should be learning is not simply syntax, but rather concepts and how to find answers from credible sources. 
<br>
Thankfully, I am no stranger to searching for answers online. When I went from working at a large corporation to running a start-up, the training wheels literally came off. There were no more manuals, training sessions or rotational programs. What I did have was my own experience and intuition, the ear of a few smart partners, and a search bar. 

<br>
One thing I learned at that time is what is really means to be curious. I learned how to identify credible sourcesfor information, ask my network for help when I couldn't find one, and find the right way to do something through trial and error. I see the same skills as key to being a successful software engineer.

**I have compilled the most useful links that I used in building my Sinatra project in hopes that a future student finds it useful when building their project.**

<h2> <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"> CSS flexbox tutorial </a> </h2>


I got really stuck on CSS styling, and finally landed on a flexbox layout to show both my book index and user index. This is a good wak through of the potential properties. 


<h2> <a href="https://medium.com/@virtual_khan/sinatra-and-shotgun-problems-with-port-9393-in-use-73735f353d26" > Find and kill a port in use  </a></h2>

I ran into a problem using shotgun, getting an error that port 9393 was in use. This post helped me resolve that problem.


<h2> <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html"> Ruby docs for Active Record associations </a></h2>

Not only a great bookmark to reference syntax for Active Record maros, but also features diagrams to visually represent associations. 


<h2> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp"> w3schools guide to HTML and CSS </a> </h2>

Rather than memorizing html and css syntax, I keep w3schools bookmarked for a quick reference. 


<h2> <a href="http://www.restular.com/"> RESTful routes  </a></h2>

The best resource for building routes in Sinatra! 


<h2> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9249359/vertically-align-text-within-a-div"> Vertical alignment </a></h2>

Aligning text and images was more tricky than I would have guessed. I found this Stack Overflow question that helped.


<h2> <a href="https://medium.com/@christine_tran/deploying-sinatra-app-to-heroku-8c64f025db77"> Deploying a Sinatra app to Heroku </a></h2>

This is a guide shared amoung current students of how to deploy a Sinatra app onto Heroku. Not required for the project, but great to do to make the app easy to share.
