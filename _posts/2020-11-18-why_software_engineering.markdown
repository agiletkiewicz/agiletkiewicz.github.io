My career up until now has been in fashion retail, so I want to share what led me to comlete a software engineering bootcamp. 

I spent the earlier part of my retail career in buying and merchandising and I loved it. I chose retail and my specific discipline not because of a great love of fashion trends, but because of the intersection of business and creative that it entails; to plan for next year's inventory it is necessary to both analyse data and understand what makes a product aesthetically pleasing.

As I continued in my career I became more interested in sustainability in the fashion industry. This led to me joining the founding team of online secondhand fashion company SilkRoll. I joined initially to bring my fashion merchandising expertise to the team; to develop pricing stratagies, build reports and advise on consumer trends. As time went on I also took on operations and marketing for the start-up. 

Operations became my main focus at SilkRoll as it takes a lot to process a single secondhand garment and get it up on a website in way that both provides a great customer experience and is viable for the business. I am very proud of what we have built at SilkRoll because it allows us to bring secondhand items to customers in what feels like a full-price experience. Ultimately, if SilkRoll didn't privide a great experience customers wouldn't use it. Also, if we couldn't provide this experience quickly and efficiently, we couldn't stay alive as a business. 

I am very passionate about expanding access to secondhand clothing as the fashion industry has a large impact on waste and greenhouse gas emissions: nearly 20% of global waste and 4% of global emissions are created by the fashion industry. Most of the impact is from manufacturing of new garments, so increasing the share of secondhand purchases is an incredibly effective way to decrease this impact. 

I realised this: technology played a huge role in our operations, and therefore in creating a great customer experience and a path toward increased sustainability in the fashion industry. 

I became fascinated with how we used technology to make processes easier and faster. I worked closley with and eventually took over for our director of operations technology. After parting with SilkRoll, I wanted to keep using technology to solve problems and create outstanding customer experiences. That is what brought me to Flatiron School.

I have loved my time at Flatiron because I have learned that coding is a combination of art and science, just like retail. And just like being a fashion buyer, I can bring an exciting customer experience to life. I can't wait to see what customer experience I get to create next.
